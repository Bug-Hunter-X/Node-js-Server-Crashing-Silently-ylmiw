# Node.js Server Crashing Silently

This repository demonstrates a scenario where a Node.js server crashes without providing any error messages or logs in the console. The server starts and immediately exits, making debugging difficult.

## Problem
The `server.js` file contains a simple HTTP server.  However, when running this server, it crashes without any indication of the cause.  No error messages are displayed in the console.

## Solution
The `serverSolution.js` file contains a corrected version.  The issue is likely related to unhandled exceptions or improper use of asynchronous operations within the request handling logic.  Proper error handling and logging are crucial for debugging and preventing such silent failures.
